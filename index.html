        <center>Hey there, My name is Abduljabbar Abdulghani. Welcome to my Portfolio. Here you will learn abit about who i am and what i do.
           As the world evolves technologically, Programming languages will soon be a second mother tongue. being a programmer is that you can get to work in teams , apply your knowledge at home & have a positive job growth , The drawback in this business is that the work environment tend to be the same , high level of stress and need to be committed to the job and work long hours.

           <b>Give us this day our daily output. And forgive us our code duplication, as we forgive those who duplicate code against us. And lead us not into frustration; but deliver us from GOTOs. For thine is the algorithm, the computation, and the solution, looping forever and ever.
           </b>
