        <center>Hey there, My name is Abduljabbar Abdulghani. Welcome to my Portfolio. Here you will learn abit about who i am and what i do.
           As the world evolves technologically, Programming languages will soon be a second mother tongue. being a programmer is that you can get to work in teams , apply your knowledge at home & have a positive job growth , The drawback in this business is that the work environment tend to be the same , high level of stress and need to be committed to the job and work long hours.

           <b>Give us this day our daily output. And forgive us our code duplication, as we forgive those who duplicate code against us. And lead us not into frustration; but deliver us from GOTOs. For thine is the algorithm, the computation, and the solution, looping forever and ever.

        <center>The programming skill is important for learning to innovate, create eco-friendly solutions for global problems. Programming is important in our daily life to enhance and increase the power of computers and the internet.
           Programming is important for speeding up the input and output processes in a machine. Programming is important to automate, collect, manage, calculate, analyze the processing of data and information accurately.
           Programming is important to create software and applications that help computer and mobile users in daily life. Due to all these reasons, itâ€™s really important to learn how to use programming languages in our daily life.
           I developed my love for programming along the path to understanding computer issue solving better. In my years of computer repair, most of the issues have been software based and i was struggling to solve these problems without the nessesary knowledge.

           <strong>"In some ways, programming is like painting. You start with a blank canvas and certain basic raw materials. You use a combination of science, art, and craft to determine what to do with them." - Andrew Hunt</strong>
